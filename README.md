# Summer High School Math Problem Sets

To me, there always seemed to be a disconnect between the dry, tedious, math that 
standardized tests like the ACT, SAT, etc. emphasized and the math
that I grew up loving. Especially puzzling was how educators bemoaned America's
youth's lack of interest in math while at the same time, pushed for 
increasingly more standardized tests that took all the joy and discovery out of 
our classrooms.

So when my mom suggested that my sister spend her summer preparing for the PSAT,
I offered to make my own set of math problems for my sister to do instead, in the hopes that
I would be saving her from a summer of rote computation. In my problem sets, I strived to 
communicate a small portion of the fascination with which mathematics had enthralled me in ever since I was a kid. 
In particular, I used problems that I had run across in my various academic adventures
that I found intriguing or useful in the real world.

This repo contains the product of that work. Both the pdf version and the latex
source code are included. 
The problem sets are split into 3 parts, each part relatively balanced across the following sections:

1. Intro to Linear Algebra/Calculus
2. Applied Problems
3. Pure math problems
4. Mental Computation/Readings

These problems are aimed at high school students, ideally those who are taking, or have taken algebra and/or trigonometry.

I hope you enjoy and please feel free to add commits or point out errors.

To encourage truly deep thought, as well as group collaboration, solutions are not provided!
