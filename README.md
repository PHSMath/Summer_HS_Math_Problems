# Summer_HS_Math_Problems

I always found the disconnect between the dry, tedious, math that 
standardized tests like the ACT, SAT, etc. emphasized and the math
that I grew up loving to be concerning, especially given the growing
national concern over our school children's math abilities.

So when my mom suggested that my sister spend her summer preparing for the PSAT,
 I decided to make my own set of math problems for her instead, in the hopes that
I would be saving her from a summer of rote computation and instead, try to 
communicate a small portion of the fascination with which mathematics had enthralled me in ever since I was a kid.

This repo contains the product of that result. It contains both the pdf version and the latex
source code. The problems are split into 3 parts, each part relatively well balanced across (roughly) the following sections

1. Intro to Linear Algebra/Calculus
2. Applied Problems
3. Pure math problems
4. Mental Computation/Readings

These problems are aimed at high school students, ideally those who are taking, or have taken, either algebra and/or trigonometry.

I hope you enjoy and please feel free to add commits or point out errors.

To encourage truly deep thought, as well as group collaboration, solutions are not provided!
